### 📝 **Abstract**
Flooding remains a significant challenge in Thailand due to its geographical setup. Flood susceptibility mapping is crucial for managing these events. Traditionally, the GIS-based FRAM model combined with AHP has been employed to create flood susceptibility maps. However, with the rise of machine learning, we explored the potential of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to enhance these maps. Our study compares the GIS approach and ANN, using Ayutthaya Province as a case study. Results show that ANN outperforms FRAM, providing more accurate flood susceptibility predictions using fewer causal factors.
