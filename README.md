# Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Accurate Rainfall Prediction

Welcome to the repository for **"Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Accurate Rainfall Prediction"**. This project, developed by Teerapong Panboonyuen (Kao Panboonyuen), focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of rainfall predictions.

## Overview

Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for various sectors, including agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. This project explores a range of machine learning algorithms to improve the precision and reliability of rainfall forecasts. By comparing traditional methods with advanced models, this work aims to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in meteorological applications.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Implementation**: Includes implementations of various machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation**: Rigorous performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of results for better interpretation and analysis.
